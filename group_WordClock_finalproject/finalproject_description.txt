In this final project, I designed, built, and wired a word clock powered by an Arduino. I have also linked a GUI to processing for settting the time. Currently, it requires the user to plug in the USB cable into a computer to set the time, and to plug in a 9V power adapter. Once the time has been set, the USB can be disconnected and the clock will run as it should.

As for the actual guts of the machine, the Arduino powers 16 shift registers, which each control 8 LEDS (except for the last one, which only powers 1). There are 121 LEDS that can each be controlled individually, meaning that if I wanted to change the lettering board, I would only have to change the code itself and not do any extra wiring.

One of the major unexpected problems was the whole entire process. I redesigned the wiring many times, switching from LED strips to word-linked LEDS to individually linked LEDS. I failed about 8 times to print my circuit board, and the wiring was too long so I had to ziptie the size down.

All in all, this was a very fun and rewarding project, and I plan to make improvements upon it in the future. Perhaps adding physical buttons to change the time so the USB is no longer needed, or making the box thinner.
